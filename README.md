# esoExtensions
This repository is for extensions to the eso forum software. This includes language packs, skins, and plugins. This repository is meant as a place where one can download just about every known extension, without having to hunt down every single one seperately.

Disclaimer: Not all of these files were created by me. Unless it's written otherwise, I didn't create it.
